**_We’re about to kick off with Susan Kasselveild, High Cleric of the Halls of Light within the kingdom of the Morrowlands, who really needs no introduction, and Janet Kasselveild, Queen of the royal family. I mean, really, neither of you need introductions._**

**_We are at the height of political warfare within the kingdom. We have ongoing conflict in the south, which many people say are simply people fighting against each other but are instead cultists killing off a huge chunk and enslaving many. In fact, that’s what you say, Susan, but first I would like your opinion on this, Janet._**

JANET

We have a political situation which has took a turn for the worst. Me and my husband, Marcus, have understood for a long time that the only solution is to bring peace within our kingdom. We have been trading partners with our southern neighbours for decades. There is no intention for us to go to war with them.

SUSAN

You’re saying that with the implication the south poses a threat to us.

JANET

They do.

SUSAN

How?

JANET

The civil war there is going to spread north and it will begin to affect us. We need to take drastic defensive action as soon as possible.

**_Susan, you’ve been arguing that we need to resolve the situation directly, haven’t you?_**

SUSAN

The problem is not whether there is conflict going on in the south. Everyone can agree that is the case. However, Janet and her husband, the king, is holding back defences rather than going out there and suppressing the conflict.

JANET

We can’t just go out there and expose our forces.

SUSAN

And if we don’t do something, it will continue.

**_I’d like to interrupt just for a moment. We can both agree there is danger, but the decision has not been made to act. Surely, to back up your point, Susan, that action should be taken to sway these attacks._**

SUSAN

There is a slight problem with that. The royal throne has been silent on these issues for some time and refuse to make any announcements.

JANET

That’s because we haven’t decided yet, and we can’t make decisions lightly.

SUSAN

I never finished. Secondly, what’s going on in the south, I think, is not something the throne want to discuss because the evidence of which would deny the possibility that this civil war could be the result of radicalised ideologies manifesting their traits into the minds of complaisant children.

JANET

But that’s exactly the case, and that is why the royal throne is working hard with local newspapers to get a lead on the current situation. And as mentioned earlier, we can’t make irrational decisions.

SUSAN

Your focus on not making an irrational decision is costing us time we cannot afford, at least according to you. So, given the thought that this war might spread north, why are we wasting our time debating this when we could have sent scouts out to observe the region?

**_Please calm down. Firstly, I’d like to turn my attention to you, Susan. Your opinions have been praised by the inner-city people, overwhelmingly. However, high figures in society, including your own sister, denies your interests in keeping the kingdom safe in fear of exposing our defences._**

**_Despite that, though, what is it you think needs to happen to resolve this conflict?_**

SUSAN

What needs to happen is a calculated effort to suppress the perpetrators of the war. We need our forces in the south averting crowds and discouraging further conflict. Once that happens and the regions are safe enough, investigators can go into the villages to find out who is controlling the situation.

I think it’s cultists. There is no reason why they shouldn’t be cultists. We are dealing with the same people who created the royal family, which ironically Marcus exposed two and half years ago before becoming King.

**_What makes you think the people creating this conflict are cultists?_**

SUSAN

Since Marcus’s campaign to infiltrate the royal throne and expose the characters - myself and Janet included - for being in effect controlled by cultists, I decided I wanted to investigate the latter half of his efforts. I took a journey down to Upper Ystrii, the fort town east of Lower Ystrii - it’s mining counterpart - and did some research.

After two months, I then travelled to Vlandik, a village hidden in a valley just north of the mountains, and that’s where my eyes really opened. The people there were extremely sceptical, nervous and shaken when looking at me, and most dared to look twice.

What I saw was deep contempt for anyone that was not at least within an inch of the village. It was practically deserted in the town square when I walked there. Most people I saw were on the outskirts of the village, while the centre was a stillness, cold and bitter. Very eerie and surreal.

But what was most scary about it was that there was a mist enveloping the bell tower. Everything around it was visibly clear. Naturally, I thought it might be a good idea to go inside and have a look around. The door was locked but using my magical skills I was able to enter.

There was the circular staircase going up to the top of the tower, but with a more detailed look around the bottom floor, there was a faint but visible separation between the natural floor and what looked like a passage underground.

I managed to lift the concealment and made my way down. What I discovered down there was satanic ritual practices. Human skulls, often small ones indicating child sacrifices, were scattered on shelfs as large as a bookshelf along two-hundred metre walls. There were at least 12 shelves that I saw while down there.

**_All with skulls?_**

Yes.

**_Jeez._**

Next, was a small chamber off to the left of me leading into a circular shaped room made of cobblestone brick. There was a black carpet leading from the door down two 0.34 metre steps, which then crosses against another carpet drawn exactly 180 degrees across this circular ring. In the middle was a black stone shaped like an anvil. Above it was another circular ring on the ceiling, and on it was drawn an upside-down star in white chalk.

Finally, all around the edges of the room stood large golden candles inside what could be described as an opaque window, in front of a golden tray of fresh human blood. This was the sign of an evil I had never seen before.

**_Now, Janet. Obviously, your husband, a long time ago, was campaigning against the royal throne. You two were sisters for the better part of almost forty years, what has caused this sudden division between you two in the last two and a half years?_**

JANET

Well, strangely, two and a half years ago was when Marcus’s campaign was at its height. My sister left the royal throne and I was left behind to be exposed on my own.

**_That’s a bit disloyal to your sister, Susan, don’t you think?_**

SUSAN

Well, you say that, but I did also marry Marcus’s brother, Raphael, about two and a half years ago, a wedding that was planned six months before Marcus was well known.

Turning away from the royal throne was a personal matter than a political one. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to join my sister. Had I not been married six months hence; it would have been a different story. I wanted to spend time with my husband, I don’t see how that can be made into a political conspiracy.

**_Going back on topic, and I hope I’m not talking out of line when I ask this, but do you think, Janet, that Susan’s journey into the southern village was a good one and does the evidence stand up to validity?_**

JANET

The problem with Susan’s theory is that she didn’t bring back the evidence.

SUSAN

Well, that’s going to look spectacular, isn’t it? I come back to the inner city with a sack full of dead children’s skulls. What do you think people will think of me, if I did that?

JANET

Well, anything other than that?

SUSAN

There was nothing else to bring back to the city. I saw a satanic sacrificial chamber with all your typical symbolism one would expect of a sacrificial chamber, and a ton of skulls. Nothing else.

**_What I’m curious of, is why would anyone allow you to enter the tower and into the underground?_**

SUSAN

There was no one guarding it.

**_So, how do we know these are cultists we are dealing with?_**

SUSAN

Are you even listening to yourself? If you minus the idea of extra-terrestrials for a minute, a cultist is someone who follows a religious or extremist ideology. Satanism by its very definition is a cult.

These are cultist practices we are dealing with, there is no doubt about it. Perhaps it is more appropriate to call them Satanists, but it doesn’t disprove my point.

**_How do extra-terrestrials come into the equation?_**

SUSAN

Easy. About two centuries ago, the Morrowlands didn’t even exist. There are plenty of accounts, books and writings that all tell of the time when Maron cultists came down to the planet and enslaved exposed Atlanteans and forced them to build a fortress north of Atlantis, deep in the mountains and forged beneath the earth with no hope of finding it.

These cultists amassed a force capable enough to bring down Atlantis, but they failed. The reason they failed was because there was more to Atlantis’ defence than what was previously known, including to the Maron. From our point of view, Atlantis appears to be encapsulated by a large 22-mile wide glass dome and about 11 miles high. That’s larger than any city built since.

The glass is two hundred metres thick and is reinforced with thin carbon sheets every two metres. That’s one hundred carbon sheets that keeps anything from penetrating the shell. We haven’t even mentioned the technological prowess of our ancestors inside the city.

Besides, it’s a little off topic, but I must explain just how well protected Atlantis is for anyone who doesn’t know our full history. Because of this physical protection, these Maron cultists had to think of another way in.

North of the inner city lies what we consider to be a dead forest. It used to be a massive ritual site, built in the shape and size of Atlantis with sacrificial chambers made at specific cardinal points representing houses inside the city. What the cultists then did was use these chambers to enter the city unnoticed, but only through subliminal programming could they even influence the people there.

And so, they conducted a massive undertaking involving the use of what you might consider “micro-magic”, tapping into the minds of suggestible children and influenced them against their parents. Those who fell for the scam were quickly forced down from the realm of Atlantis to here.

And now we have the Morrowlands. Obviously, these cultists want us for something. And Marcus, who happened to be against the royal family who somehow managed to acquire the knowledge that convinced the public the throne was up to no good, is now ironically King.

JANET

This whole idea that somehow, we are controlled by cultists is nonsense.

SUSAN

Says a member of the royal family.

JANET

Look. Cultists did not force people down to the third dimension from Atlantis. Clearly, a decision was made some time ago that these families wanted to visit the third dimension but couldn’t return to their home. How hard is that to grasp?

SUSAN

The problem with that idea is that no human would, in their right mind, knowing the sun cycle is about to close off, go to the third dimension knowing they couldn’t return to the city.

JANET

Yeah, but how are they going to know that?

**_I’d just like to interrupt for a moment. Explain to people what a sun cycle is, Susan._**

SUSAN

Okay. This is based on Maya philosophy and their calendars. They predicted based on their Long Count calendar that roughly 5,126 years is the length of an entire sun cycle. I personally think it’s 5,096 years when you take into account the Tzolkin calendar, but that’s beside the point.

At the end of the cycle, the sun reaches its peak frequency, and at the beginning of the next sun cycle the sun’s frequency drops back down. During the period between the two cycles, whatever difference there is in the peak and base line of frequencies constitutes a frequency band, allowing people within those realms of frequency to traverse between them with ease.

It is a lot more difficult to traverse between frequencies without being subject to this sun cycle. We happen to have previously lived through such a phase, but why would no one inside Atlantis decide simply to just go to the third dimension? Because there was a clear and present threat in the cultists and none of them would risk it.

And to answer your question, Janet, they would know when the sun cycle is about to close by reading the Mayan calendars. Atlantis has at least one copy of the original, just like we do.

JANET

What about families? They’re not going to be in constant understanding of the Mayan calendars.

SUSAN

The ability to communicate telepathically in the fourth dimension is abundant, there is no reason for families in Atlantis to not know that was the case.

I’m telling you right now, cultists are behind this. We have been blinded by ignorance for far too long. I have given examples and presented my evidence in the best way I can. There is no longer a debate to be had. Action needs to be done to sway these attacks in the south to prevent further conflict, and the lack of it should bring the ruling family into question at the very least.

**_Why are you attacking your sister so harshly?_**

SUSAN

I never even mentioned Janet in my last statement. It doesn’t just include her; it includes all the ruling family.

JANET

Including you, by the way.

SUSAN

I’m not part of the ruling family, and dare I say I would rather die than be a part of it now.

_\<Janet drops her jaw\>_

**_That is extremely offensive, Susan. You should apologise right away for your gross misconduct._**

SUSAN

No, and for one simple reason: Freedom. You brought me here today to discuss the issues revolving around the south and at least you have let me talk. The problem now is that you are attempting to consolidate personal differences in a political context, and I am not okay with that.

That was not what I agreed to coming into this discussion.

JANET

You are missing the point…

**_Janet, hold, please. Susan, you are denying apology because of freedom? Don’t you realise that freedom invokes tragedy on others? You have insulted your own sister on public media._**

SUSAN

Being offended is a choice. Besides, that’s not what Janet is saying.

**_I don’t need prior permission from her._**

SUSAN

Don’t assume unjustified speech as a weapon on behalf of those you couldn’t care less about, anyway. Janet, what do you say?

**_I never said I didn’t care about Janet._**

SUSAN

Shut it. Janet, what do you say? Do you think I’m offending you by claiming I’d rather die than return to the royal throne?

JANET

I’m a little offended by that, yes.

**_Well, there you go, then, Susan._**

JANET

_Except_… only on a personal level. I mean, the idea that you wouldn’t return to the royal throne to consul me or perhaps enlighten me on ideas you have encountered would be a disadvantage and I think your knowledge would help us understand our southern neighbours a bit more.

SUSAN

Okay, fair enough. But that wasn’t _my_ point. The reason I wouldn’t return was because of the political motives you and your husband have. Forgive me for speaking out of context, but the absence of any remedial actions revolving our southern neighbours has me worried and I am concerned that darker forces are manipulating behaviour within the throne.

I don’t need to explain myself any further than that, and that’s why I have decided - _politically_ - not to return to the royal throne. I don’t know how that can be construed as a disservice to our people when corruption within the throne is beginning to show.

People want to see action, and this is what I propose. We get scouts down there and observe the scene, and if there are cultists attempting to manipulate chaos in these villages, we need to help our people.

JANET

_If_ these cultists actually exist.

**_Before we finish this conversation, I have a question for you, Janet. If you were to send out scouts and you do in fact find out cultists are, to put it in Susan’s words, “manipulating chaos”, what is the next action?_**

JANET

Well, we would have to have another discussion. Although I’m Queen, I’m hesitant to make any bold decisions without the help and advice of others, and that’s why we have debates like this.

**_So, you agree that we should send out scouts?_**

JANET

Susan makes a good case for her argument. Scouts are unlikely to be noticed, and it’s not like we’re sending an army out there to investigate and potentially getting caught on the wrong end of the stick. So, I do suppose that Susan’s proposal is fair and reasonable, but should these scouts be noticed any information they could potentially divulge will become repugnant.

SUSAN

That’s a very bold statement - repugnant. An adjective in this context I would consider meaning inconsistent, in other words, inconsistent with the official narrative.

JANET

That’s not what I meant at all by that.

SUSAN

Then what did you mean?

JANET

Opposing more so than inconsistent. Perhaps I should have made myself a little clearer. My point is, however, is that scouts who might divulge information without otherwise looking out for signs of upheaval who do happen to take note of events would surely be wise not to misconstrue their findings and present them in a coherent manner that does not do an injustice to the survival stakes of everyone in this city.

SUSAN

Pfft. Jeez.

**_What is it, Susan?_**

SUSAN

Just… That’s a lot of jumbled up words in one sentence without getting to the real point.

JANET

Oh, right, says you who went on raving mad about your journey into the south to discover some random satanic practices done by who knows who because apparently this unguarded and concealed tower is so suspicious that you had to take a look. It makes a lot of sense to me, now.

SUSAN

You know, I’m not a big fan of your sarcasm. But, nevertheless. I have made my point loud and clear. People can choose how they wish to construe that point and whether to agree on it or not. You - on the other hand - have presented nothing else other than agreement in the ten minutes we have been talking, so it seems to me that perhaps I should return to the royal throne and give my stance on things.

I might just learn what’s going on inside the throne after all these years.

**_As we come to a close, I would like to say a big thank you to you both for coming and joining me and taking the time out of your busy lives to get to the bottom of this issue. So, with that in mind, thank you._**
